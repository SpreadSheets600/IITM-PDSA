    "Graphs are a way to represent relationships between objects. A graph is a collection of nodes and edges. Nodes are sometimes called vertices. Edges are lines that connect nodes. If the edges have a direction, the graph is called a directed graph. If the edges do not have a direction, the graph is called an undirected graph."
