    "### Linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a data structure consisting of collection of objects called nodes which together represent a sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists."

    "### Why Use linked lists ? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic size \n",
    "    - Linked lists are dynamic data structures, which can grow and shrink as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ease of insertion/deletion \n",
    "    -  Elements can be easily inserted or deleted without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Less memory wastage \n",
    "    - In an array, the size must be specified at the beginning. However, in a linked list, memory is allocated only when a new element is inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. No need to specify size at the beginning \n",
    "    - In a linked list, the size does not need to be specified at the beginning. It can change during the execution of the program."
