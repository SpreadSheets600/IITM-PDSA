    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python function `sumsquare` calculates the sum of squares of odd and even numbers in a given list separately. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**: `def sumsquare(lst):` defines a function named `sumsquare` that takes a list `lst` as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Odd Sum Calculation**: `odd_sum = sum(x**2 for x in lst if x % 2 != 0)` computes the sum of squares of all odd numbers in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Even Sum Calculation**: `even_sum = sum(x**2 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)` computes the sum of squares of all even numbers in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Statement**: `return [odd_sum, even_sum]` returns a list containing the two sums: the first element is the sum of squares of odd numbers, and the second is the sum of squares of even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then takes a list input from the user, evaluates it, and prints the result of the `sumsquare` function."
