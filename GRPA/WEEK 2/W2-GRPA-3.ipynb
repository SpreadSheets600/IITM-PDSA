    "### Function Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - The function `mergeInPlace` takes two arguments, `A` and `B`, which are expected to be lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Pointers**:\n",
    "   - `i` is initialized to 0, representing the current index in list `A`.\n",
    "   - `j` is initialized to 0, representing the current index in list `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Get Lengths of Lists**:\n",
    "   - `lenA` is set to the length of list `A`.\n",
    "   - `lenB` is set to the length of list `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Loop**:\n",
    "   - A `while` loop runs as long as `i` is less than `lenA` and `j` is less than `lenB`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compare Elements**:\n",
    "   - If the current element in `A` (`A[i]`) is greater than the current element in `B` (`B[j]`):\n",
    "     - Swap `A[i]` with `B[j]` using a hypothetical `swap` method (note: Python lists do not have a `swap` method, so this would need to be implemented separately).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sort `B` After Swap**:\n",
    "   - After swapping, a nested `while` loop ensures that the swapped element in `B` is placed in the correct position to maintain the sorted order of `B`.\n",
    "   - This loop runs as long as `k + 1` is less than `lenB` and `B[k]` is greater than `B[k + 1]`, swapping adjacent elements in `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Increment `i`**:\n",
    "   - Increment `i` to move to the next element in `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Final Check**:\n",
    "   - After the main loop, if the first element of `A` (`A[0]`) is greater than the first element of `B` (`B[0]`), swap them to ensure the smallest element is in `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "- The `swap` method used in the code is not a built-in method in Python lists. You would need to implement this method or use a different approach to swap elements between lists.\n",
