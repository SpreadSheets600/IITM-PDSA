    "1. **Sorting the List**: The first step is to sort the list $ L $. This allows us to easily access subsets of $ P $ elements that are close in value, which is essential for minimizing the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating Through Subsets**: After sorting, we iterate through the list using a sliding window approach. For each possible starting index $ i $, we consider the subset of $ P $ elements starting from that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculating Differences**: For each subset, we calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which can be directly obtained from the sorted list as $ L[i + P - 1] - L[i] $.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tracking Minimum Difference**: We maintain a variable to track the minimum difference found during our iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning Result**: Finally, we return the smallest difference found.\n"
